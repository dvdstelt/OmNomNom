## Service Composition in the UI

The demo heavily relies on [ServiceComposer](https://github.com/ServiceComposer/ServiceComposer.AspNetCore/), a package built by [Mauro Servienti](https://github.com/mauroservienti). He discusses it deeply in many posts in the [ViewModel Composition](https://milestone.topics.it/categories/view-model-composition) category on his weblog.
